The Repo for the SharpFutures Web App. 

#How to use
When you want to make changes to the code clone the code to your desktop. When you want to add those changes to the repo, make sure you do it via new branch and submit a pull request. We can then review the changes and if everyone agrees it can be merged with the master.
One other thing **DON'T ALTER THE MASTER BRANCH!!!**

This [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) should help explain it a lot better. Also if your using the command line check out this [cheat sheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) it contains pretty much everything that's needed for the command line.

When commiting changes make sure you include a message telling us all what's been changed.
